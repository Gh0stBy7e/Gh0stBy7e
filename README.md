Heya? Guess I'm gonna introduce myself a bit more personal on here?

My name's Ray (actually that's just a synonym but what gives)

I'm 18 years old.

Got into computers ever since I got my first laptop, kinda wanted to work with 'em ever since.

With time, I also got more and more into hacking, installed my first Kali Linux and.. didn't know what to do with it 
乁⁠|⁠ ⁠･⁠ ⁠〰⁠ ⁠･⁠ ⁠|⁠ㄏ

Got a first proper pc upgrade, a custom build on a budget, with the intention of upgrading it.

Runs on a windows 10 and a Kali linux (By now I DO know what to do with it and how to operate it! :D)

As of now, I'm what most would call a "script kiddie", though I gotta say, I'm not a fan of that term.

Either way, I'm willing to learn on here, so if anyone has something to teach me and wants to help me out, go for it! Every bit of help is welcome here <3

And.. I guess that was it for now?

See ya!
